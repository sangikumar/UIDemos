		A Large Cave Revealed in Laos
	</h2>
	
	<p>
		An expedition in February 2008, co-led by veteran caver John Pollack,
		comprehensively mapped and photographed the 5.9-mile (9.5-kilometer)
		length of the little-known cavern for the first time.

		The explorers encountered some of the largest rooms and most impressive
		structures of any river cave on Earth, Pollack said.
	<p>
	</p>
		A river cave is any cave with an active water source flowing through it.
	<p>
	</p>
		Everything about the cave is big - from its towering entrances to its
		phobia-inducing spiders, which can be 10 inches (25 centimeters) across,
		Pollack added.
	<p>
		"It's also extremely well decorated with spectacular formations",
		Pollack said.
